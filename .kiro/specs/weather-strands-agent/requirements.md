# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves developing a weather Strands Agent using Python that integrates with the OpenWeather API and deploying it to Amazon Bedrock's AgentCore Runtime. The agent will allow users to query weather information for any city using natural language, leveraging Strands Agent's model-driven approach with built-in HTTP request capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to ask for weather information of any city through a conversational interface, so that I can get current weather data without manually calling APIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a city name THEN the system SHALL query the OpenWeather API using the built-in http_request tool
2. WHEN the OpenWeather API returns weather data THEN the system SHALL present the information in a user-friendly format
3. WHEN the API call is made THEN the system SHALL use the endpoint format: http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={{city}}&appid={OPENWEATHER_API_KEY}&units=metric

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create a simple weather_agent.py file using Strands Agent framework, so that I can implement the weather querying functionality with minimal code complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the agent THEN the system SHALL use Python and the Strands Agent framework
2. WHEN defining the agent THEN the system SHALL leverage the built-in http_request tool for API calls
3. WHEN implementing the agent THEN the system SHALL keep the code simple without extensive testing or error handling
4. WHEN the agent is created THEN it SHALL be executable and functional for weather queries

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy the weather agent to Amazon Bedrock's AgentCore Runtime, so that it can be accessed and invoked remotely with proper AWS infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the agent THEN the system SHALL use the us-east-1 AWS region
2. WHEN configuring deployment THEN the system SHALL run `agentcore configure` to create required IAM Role and ECR
3. WHEN launching the agent THEN the system SHALL run `agentcore launch` to deploy to AgentCore Runtime
4. WHEN testing deployment THEN the system SHALL run `agentcore invoke` to verify functionality
5. WHEN deploying THEN the agent SHALL be named `weather_agent_kiro`

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to document the deployed agent's infrastructure details, so that future frontend development can integrate with the weather agent service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment is complete THEN the system SHALL create a weather-agent-api.md file
2. WHEN documenting THEN the file SHALL include AgentCore ARN information
3. WHEN documenting THEN the file SHALL include IAM Role details
4. WHEN documenting THEN the file SHALL include ECR Repository URI
5. WHEN documenting THEN the file SHALL include any other relevant infrastructure information for frontend integration

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure proper development environment setup, so that the project runs consistently and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing THEN the system SHALL use the uv Python virtual environment .venv
2. WHEN configuring AWS THEN the system SHALL use the workshop-profile as the AWS configure profile
3. WHEN researching implementation details THEN the system SHALL use MCP tools to access Strands Agent and AWS documentation
4. WHEN development is complete THEN the system SHALL clean up any unnecessary test files
5. WHEN implementing THEN the system SHALL follow official documentation and examples
