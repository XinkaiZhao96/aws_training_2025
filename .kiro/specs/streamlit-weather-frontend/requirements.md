# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves developing a Streamlit frontend application for the already deployed Weather Strands Agent on Amazon Bedrock's AgentCore Runtime. The frontend will provide a user-friendly chat interface that allows users to interact with the weather agent through natural language queries, supporting weather information, event discovery, and sunrise/sunset times for cities worldwide.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with the weather agent through a conversational chat interface, so that I can easily ask questions about weather, events, and sun times in natural language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a message THEN the system SHALL display it in the chat interface with proper user styling
2. WHEN the system processes a query THEN it SHALL show a loading indicator with appropriate message
3. WHEN the agent responds THEN the system SHALL display the response with proper markdown formatting
4. WHEN displaying messages THEN the system SHALL include timestamps for each message
5. WHEN rendering agent responses THEN the system SHALL use st.markdown() to properly display weather information formatting

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the connection status and system information in a sidebar, so that I can understand if the system is working properly and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display connection status (green for connected, red for error)
2. WHEN there are connection issues THEN the system SHALL show specific error messages
3. WHEN displaying system info THEN the system SHALL show AWS region and Agent ID
4. WHEN the user clicks test connection THEN the system SHALL verify connectivity and show results
5. WHEN the user clicks clear conversation THEN the system SHALL remove all chat messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use quick action buttons for common queries, so that I can quickly get weather information for popular cities without typing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display quick action buttons for major cities
2. WHEN a user clicks a quick action button THEN the system SHALL automatically send the corresponding query
3. WHEN processing quick actions THEN the system SHALL prevent multiple simultaneous requests
4. WHEN buttons are clicked THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to handle errors gracefully, so that users receive helpful feedback when things go wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AWS authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display specific authentication error messages
2. WHEN the agent is unavailable THEN the system SHALL show service unavailability messages
3. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide network troubleshooting suggestions
4. WHEN API rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL suggest retry timing
5. WHEN errors are retryable THEN the system SHALL indicate this to the user

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see example queries and usage instructions, so that I understand how to effectively use the weather agent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display example queries in an expandable section
2. WHEN showing examples THEN the system SHALL categorize them by type (weather, events, sun times, combined)
3. WHEN displaying the interface THEN the system SHALL include clear instructions and welcome message
4. WHEN users need help THEN the system SHALL provide contextual guidance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to integrate properly with the deployed AgentCore runtime, so that it can successfully invoke the weather agent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL use the correct Agent ARN and AWS region
2. WHEN authenticating THEN the system SHALL use the workshop-profile AWS credentials
3. WHEN invoking the agent THEN the system SHALL use the proper payload format with "prompt" field
4. WHEN receiving responses THEN the system SHALL parse the JSON response and extract the "result" field
5. WHEN handling AWS SDK calls THEN the system SHALL use boto3 with bedrock-agentcore client

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to have a responsive and intuitive design, so that I can use it effectively on different devices and screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL use appropriate Streamlit page configuration
2. WHEN displaying the interface THEN the system SHALL use proper layout with sidebar and main content
3. WHEN showing chat messages THEN the system SHALL use st.chat_message() for proper styling
4. WHEN rendering content THEN the system SHALL support emoji and Chinese text properly
5. WHEN using the interface THEN the system SHALL provide smooth user experience with proper state management

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to run in the uv virtual environment, so that it uses the correct dependencies and follows project standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing THEN the system SHALL use the .venv virtual environment with uv
2. WHEN installing dependencies THEN the system SHALL use streamlit and boto3 packages
3. WHEN running the application THEN the system SHALL execute correctly in the virtual environment
4. WHEN testing THEN the system SHALL verify that the weather agent can be invoked successfully
5. WHEN deployment is complete THEN the system SHALL clean up any unnecessary test files
