# Technical Decisions - Weather Strands Agent

## Framework and Technology Choices

### 1. Strands Agents Framework
**Decision**: Use Strands Agents as the core framework for the weather agent  
**Rationale**: 
- Purpose-built for LLM-based agent development
- Excellent integration with AWS Bedrock AgentCore
- Built-in tool support for HTTP requests
- Comprehensive system prompt capabilities

**Alternatives Considered**: LangChain, custom agent implementation  
**Trade-offs**: Strands Agents provides better AWS integration but less community resources than LangChain

### 2. AWS Bedrock AgentCore Deployment
**Decision**: Deploy using AWS Bedrock AgentCore runtime  
**Rationale**:
- Managed infrastructure for agent hosting
- Built-in observability and logging
- Scalable and cost-effective
- Native integration with other AWS services

**Alternatives Considered**: EC2 deployment, Lambda functions, EKS  
**Trade-offs**: Less control over infrastructure but significantly reduced operational overhead

### 3. Streamlit Frontend
**Decision**: Use Streamlit for the web frontend  
**Rationale**:
- Rapid development and prototyping
- Python-native, matching backend technology
- Built-in responsive components
- Easy integration with backend APIs

**Alternatives Considered**: React, Flask with templates, FastAPI with frontend  
**Trade-offs**: Less customization flexibility but much faster development time

### 4. Multi-API Integration Strategy
**Decision**: Integrate multiple APIs (OpenWeather, Eventbrite, Sunrise-Sunset) with graceful degradation  
**Rationale**:
- Provides comprehensive city information
- Redundancy improves user experience
- Natural language queries can combine multiple data sources

**Implementation**: HTTP request tool with comprehensive error handling

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Container-First Deployment
**Decision**: Use Docker containers for deployment  
**Rationale**:
- Consistent environment across development and production
- Easy scaling and deployment
- Isolation of dependencies
- Platform independence

**Configuration**: Multi-stage Docker build with Python 3.12 base image

### 2. Environment Variable Configuration
**Decision**: Use environment variables for API keys and configuration  
**Rationale**:
- Security best practice
- Easy deployment across environments
- No sensitive data in code repository
- Standard cloud deployment pattern

**Implementation**: Template-based configuration files with placeholder values

### 3. MCP Server Integration
**Decision**: Include Model Context Protocol (MCP) server configurations  
**Rationale**:
- Enhanced development experience with Kiro IDE
- Access to documentation and tools during development
- Improved debugging and testing capabilities

**Servers Included**: Strands Agents docs, AWS docs, Figma integration

## API Design Decisions

### 1. Natural Language Query Processing
**Decision**: Accept natural language queries rather than structured API calls  
**Rationale**:
- Better user experience
- Leverages LLM capabilities
- Flexible query interpretation
- Supports complex multi-part requests

**Example**: "Tell me about weather and events in London" → combines weather and event data

### 2. Comprehensive Error Handling
**Decision**: Implement graceful degradation when APIs are unavailable  
**Rationale**:
- Improved reliability
- Better user experience
- Prevents complete application failure
- Provides informative error messages

**Implementation**: Try-catch blocks with fallback responses

### 3. Response Format Standardization
**Decision**: Standardize response formats across different API integrations  
**Rationale**:
- Consistent user experience
- Easier frontend integration
- Simplified error handling
- Better maintainability

## Security Decisions

### 1. API Key Management
**Decision**: Remove all API keys from repository and use environment variables  
**Rationale**:
- Prevents accidental exposure
- Follows security best practices
- Enables different keys per environment
- Complies with GitHub security policies

**Implementation**: Template configuration files with clear placeholder values

### 2. Git History Cleaning
**Decision**: Use git filter-branch to remove sensitive data from history  
**Rationale**:
- Complete removal of exposed secrets
- Maintains clean repository history
- Prevents future security issues
- Enables safe public repository

### 3. Comprehensive .gitignore
**Decision**: Create extensive .gitignore file covering multiple scenarios  
**Rationale**:
- Prevents future accidental commits of sensitive data
- Excludes build artifacts and temporary files
- Follows Python and Docker best practices
- Includes IDE-specific exclusions

## Development Process Decisions

### 1. Spec-Driven Development
**Decision**: Follow structured specification workflow (Requirements → Design → Tasks)  
**Rationale**:
- Ensures comprehensive planning
- Provides clear implementation roadmap
- Enables iterative development
- Creates valuable documentation artifacts

**Outcome**: Complete specification documents in EARS format

### 2. Iterative Development with AI Assistance
**Decision**: Use AI assistant (Kiro) for guided development  
**Rationale**:
- Accelerates development process
- Provides expert guidance and best practices
- Enables rapid prototyping and iteration
- Maintains code quality standards

### 3. Documentation-First Approach
**Decision**: Create comprehensive documentation during development  
**Rationale**:
- Improves maintainability
- Enables team collaboration
- Provides clear setup instructions
- Documents technical decisions and rationale

## Performance and Scalability Decisions

### 1. Stateless Agent Design
**Decision**: Design agent as stateless with no persistent storage  
**Rationale**:
- Simplifies deployment and scaling
- Reduces infrastructure complexity
- Enables horizontal scaling
- Follows cloud-native patterns

### 2. API Response Caching Strategy
**Decision**: Rely on external API caching rather than implementing custom caching  
**Rationale**:
- Reduces complexity
- Leverages provider optimizations
- Simplifies deployment
- Acceptable for current use case

**Future Consideration**: May implement Redis caching for high-traffic scenarios

### 3. Container Resource Optimization
**Decision**: Use slim base images and multi-stage builds  
**Rationale**:
- Reduces container size
- Improves deployment speed
- Reduces security surface area
- Optimizes resource usage

## Monitoring and Observability Decisions
